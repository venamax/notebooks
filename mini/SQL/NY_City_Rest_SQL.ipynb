    " \n",
    "      > Elements of a single row are _heterogeneous_ but apply to _a single logical entity_.\n",
    "      \n",
    " - It is good practice to be able to specify each row of each table by a **primary key**: that is by some column, or small combination of columns, that uniquely specifies the row.  The columns `employee_id`, `task_id`, and `assignment_id` are all of this type.  This way, if you want to refer to this row in another table you can do it succinctly by this primary key.\n",
    "      \n",
    "Here are some examples of types of \"relations\" (rows) that occur in practice:\n",
    "   1. Storing one-to-one bits of data for some sort of object: i.e. for each employee we store one name and one phone number; for each project we store one deadline and one description\n",
    "   2. Storing one-to-many or many-to-many bits of data: i.e. if we needed to be able to store _many_ phone numbers for each employee, we'd have a new table `Employee_Phone_Numbers` with columns `employee_id` and `phone_number` (the two together can be a _composite primary key_).\n",
    "    \n",
    "   Alternate, but **worse**, ways to do it would be: \n",
    "       - Adding columns to the `Employees` table for `phone_number_1` to `phone_number_10`.  This is bad because it makes it hard to query against the phone numbers and is inflexible if you want to change the number of phone numbers.  In the _object oriented_ or _key-value_ you could simply make phone_numbers a list or array, and all would be well -- this is not available in the relational model. \n",
    "       - Having the `Employee_Phone_Numbers` table duplicate the employee name and other information.  This is bad because duplication of information across tables wastes space and can lead to update errors.\n",

If you want it to be descending write e.g. `column_name1 DESC` (you can also write `ASC` for ascending to disambiguate).\n",
    "   \n",

    "   \n",
    "   If you want to just get at most the first N rows that would be returned, add on `LIMIT N`.\n",

    "_In short:_ Use this if your data is smallish (several GB max) and you want to do some SQL-based processing, _and_ if you know ahead of time that you will not need to do operations in parallel. Probably the preferred choice for mini-projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**\n",
    " - It operates on a single flat file on disk, which you can treat like any other file -- copy, scp, rename, etc.\n",
    " - It is a single small executable, comes pre-installed on many things, and doesn't require running a server.\n",
    " - Extensible (by C code).  It's open source and is small enough to be easy to modify it / write extension modules in C.\n",
    " - It has a quick and permissive (of errors) CSV loader, and doesn't stress correctness of schemas.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons**\n",
    " - It lacks some useful \"advanced\" features (in particular, JOINs in UPDATEs have to be faked via subqueries and/or temporary tables).  The workarounds are generally slower than the \"right\" approach would be.\n",
    " - It's not multi-user.  If you're running a long-running computation, you can't do anything else with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Postgresql:**\n",
    "----------------\n",
    "_In short:_  The premier free \"real\" RDBMS (i.e. SQL-type database).  Use it if you need SQL semantics and have more than several GB of data or need multi-user / multi-process access.  \n",
    "[Exception: If you have lots of data and do lots of easily parallelizable tasks, and will be running either on a cluster on a machine that fits your data in RAM, you may be better off with a specialized SQL-like system: e.g. Hive, Shark, MemSQL (commercial).]\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros**\n",
    " - Excellent support of SQL features, good performance and `\"EXPLAIN ...\"` for seeing query plans and tweaking performance.\n",
    " - Several nice SQL extensions: JSON-column support, and `Postgis` for GIS-based geographical data types and queries.\n",
    " - Extensible (in a variety of languages, _including Python_).\n",
    " \n",
    "**Cons**\n",
    " - You have to run a server.\n",
    " - The CSV loader is quick on correct data, but simply doesn't except malformed data.  Does stress correctness of schemas.\n",
    " \n",
    " \n",
    " **Other options:**\n",
    " ------------------\n",
    " - *If your data is small enough to fit _comfortably_ into memory:* \n",
    " \n",
    "   You can get by with something like `pandas` which allows for much quicker visualization and has better built in statistical support.  (There is also support for running SQL queries against pandas.  It uses sqlite behind the scenes -- beware that doing this has a performance cost over just using sqlite originally.)\n",
    " - *If you have have *lots* of data (i.e. more than any one machine you have can store on disk) or if you want to perform a task that calls for cross-machine parallelization (e.g. it makes sense to run on Hadoop):*\n",
    " \n",
    "   There are specialized SQL-like databases made for this, notably `Hive` which is built on top of Hadoop.  (Also: `Shark` and `Impala` which do the same thing with different size and performance characteristics.)\n",
