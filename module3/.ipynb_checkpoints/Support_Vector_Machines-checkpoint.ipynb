    "1. Critically, only points inside the margin or on the wrong side of the margin ($j$ for which $\\xi_j > 0$) affect the SVM (see the picture).  This is intuitively clear from the picture.  In the dual form, this is because $\\alpha_j$ is the Lagrangian constraint corresponding to $y_j (X_{j\\cdot} \\cdot \\beta + \\beta_0) \\ge (1-\\xi_j)$ and Complementary Slackness shows tells us that $\\alpha_j > 0$ is non-zero only when the constraint is binding ($y_j (X_{j\\cdot} \\cdot \\beta + \\beta_0) = (1-\\xi_j)$), i.e. we're in the boundary region.  Only these support vectors contribute to the solution.\n",
    "1. $C$ gives a trade-off between the amount of forgiveness and the size of the margin or boundary region.  Hence, it controls how many points affect the SVM (based on the distance from the boundary).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Non-linear SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "What if we don't believe that our data can be cleanly split by a linear hyperplane?  The common way to incorporate non-linear features is to have a non-linear function $h$ to map the features to another (possibly higher-dimensional) space, where the data are linearly separable.  The intuition here is that the measured feature space is a projection of this higher-dimensional space, and nonlinearities in the projection result in the nonlinear boundary between classes.\n",

    "A classic application of SVM is Outlier Detection, which is actually an Unsupervised Learning technique.  The reason it is unsupervised is that one usually has data for \"normal\" times (**inliers**) but not data for \"abnormal\" times (**outliers**).  For example, you might be looking at server logs for either abnormally high activity that might indicate security breaches or a failure in your code.  One doesn't really understand what those failure modes are *a priori*.  What you do have is a lot of log data for when the server is behaving normally.\n",

Hence, we are pushing the points away from the origin in the transformed feature space (of course, there is the usual forgiveness in terms of $\\xi$'s).  Hence, instead of penalizing for being on the \"wrong\" side of the margin for a two-sided problem, we try to push the transformed features as far from the origin as possible.  In the original feature space, this creates a region near the training points which are considered \"regular\".
