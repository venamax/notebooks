    "# PySpark Intro\n",
    "Like _Hadoop_, __Spark__ is a low-level system for distributed computation on a cluster.  It has two major advantages:\n",
    " \n",
    " - It can do in-memory caching between stages, while Hadoop must write everything to disk.  This improves performance.  It also makes it suitable for classes of algorithms that would otherwise be too slow (e.g. iterative algorithms, like the training step in many machine learning algorithms).\n",
    " \n",
    " - It has a more flexible execution model (i.e. not just MapReduce).\n",
    " \n",
    "There are also minor advantages: The default API is much nicer than writing raw MR code. The favored interface is via a language called Scala, but there is also good support for using Python.\n",
    "## How does Spark relate to Hadoop?  \n",
    "\n",
    "__Answer 1__: It's a replacement for it.  You can manage and run your own Spark cluster, independent of Hadoop.  You'll have to figure out the filesystem layer from scratch though.   (In this context, _Spark SQL_ is the replacement for _Hive_, i.e. for SQL-like operation.)\n",
    "\n",
    "__Answer 2__: It's a complement to it.  You can run Spark on top of a Hadoop cluster, and still leverage HDFS and YARN -- then Spark is just replacing MapReduce.  (In this context, _Spark SQL_ can be used as a drop-in replacement for _Hive_.)\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Spark API\n",
    "### Nouns\n",
    "The two main abstractions in Spark are:\n",
    "1. Resilient distributed datasets (RDDs):\n",
    "  This is like a (smartly) distributed list, which is partitioned across the nodes of the cluster and can be operated on in parallel.  The operations take the form of the usual functional list operations as shown above.  There are two types of operations: Transformations and Actions.\n",
    "1. Shared variables used in parallel operations: When Spark runs a function in parallel across nodes, it ships a copy of each variable needed by that function to each node.  There are two types of shared variables:\n",
    " - Broadcast variables: These are used to store a value in memory across all nodes (i.e. their values are \"broadcast\" from the driver node)\n",
    " - Accumulator variables: These are variables which are only added to across nodes, for implementing counters and sums.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Verbs\n",
    "- **Transformations:** This creates a new RDD from an old one: for instance `map` or `flatMap`.  Transformations in Spark are __lazy__, which means that they do not compute the answer right away -- only when it is needed by something else.  Instead they represent the \"idea\" of the transformation applied to the base data set (e.g. for each chaining).  In particular, this means that intermediate results to computations do not necessarily get created and stored -- if the output of your map is going straight into a reduce, Spark should be clever enough to realize this and not actually store the output of the map.  Another consequence of this design is that the results of transformations are, by default, recomputed each time they are needed -- to store them one must explicitly call `cache`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    [Transformations](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html#transformations) typically *transform* the data and return another RDD.  Common examples include `map`, `filter`, `flatMap`, and also `join`, `cogroup`, `groupByKey`, `reduceByKey`, `countByKey`, and `sample`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Actions:** These actually return a value as a result of a computation.  For instance, `reduce` is an action that combines all elements of an RDD using some function and then returns the final result.  (Note that `reduceByKey` actually returns an RDD.)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    [Actions](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/programming-guide.html#actions) typically either generate *small* outputs (e.g. `reduce`, `count`, `first`, `take`, `takeSample`, `foreach`, `collect`) or persist to disk (e.g. `saveAsTextFile`, `saveAsSequenceFile`, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions:**\n",
    "1. What's the difference between `map` and `foreach` in (non-Spark) Scala?  Why is `map` a transformation but `foreach` an action in Spark?\n",
    "1. Why is `reduceByKey` a transformation but `reduce` an action?"
