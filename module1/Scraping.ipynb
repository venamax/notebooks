(a) Setup of the system. Larvae in liquid phase of ultra-low gelling temperature agarose hydrogel are automatically loaded from a reservoir into the system with a microfluidic component, and arrayed onto a surface-treated plate as single larva-containing hydrogel droplets. Both the loading reservoir and arraying plates are placed on motorized X–Y stages, and the loading and dispensing nozzles are mounted on motorized Z stages. Depending on the desired orientation, the larvae are either agitated with a vibrating motor attached to the plate (for dorsal-up orientation) or anesthetized prior to loading (for lateral orientation). Larvae are immobilized by cooling with a thermoelectric cooler to rapidly solidify the hydrogel droplets. The system automatically identifies each larva, positions the targeted region under the injectionmicropipette, and detects the contact and penetration of the tip of the micropipette. A computer-controlled pressure driven microinjector is then triggered to inject test compounds into the target organ. After injection, a self-adhesive bottomless multi-well chamber is attached to the plate and the larvae are recovered from the hydrogel by gently flushing each droplet with embryo medium.

    "\n",
    "This pattern of nested finds, based on tag type, ID, and class, is very common. It's so common that there are two special convenience languages for such traversals: [CSS selectors](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp) and [XPath](http://www.w3schools.com/xsl/xpath_intro.asp) (which works for all XML, not just HTML). We'll be using CSS selectors, which are more common for HTML and easier to learn.\n",
    "\n",
    "With CSS selectors, we can write the above in a more concise and expressive way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "tech_divs = soup.select('div#nouvant-portfolio-content  div.technology')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All selectors work like 'find_all'.  Some basic building examples of selectors are:\n",
    "\n",
    " - `'mytag'` picks out all tags of type `mytag`.\n",
    " - `'#myid'` picks out all tags whose _id_ is equal to `myid`\n",
    " - `'.myclass'` picks out all tags whose _class_ is equal to `myclass`\n",
    " - `'mytag#myid'` will pick all tags of type `mytag` **and** `id` equal to `myid` (analogously for `'mytag.myclass'`)\n",
    " - If `'selector1'` and `'selector2'` are two selectors, then there is another selector `'selector1 selector2'`.  It picks out all tags satisfying `selector2` that are __descendents__(*) of something satisfying `selector1`, i.e. it's like our nested find.\n",
    " \n",
    " (*) It doesn't have to be a _direct_ descendent.  I.e. it can be a grand-grand-...-grand-child of something satisfying `selector1`.  For direct descendents we'd instead write `'selector1 > selector2'`\n",

    "If you are really interested in crawling, consider using `scrapy`.  [Scrapy](http://scrapy.org/) is a specialized python package for scraping websites.  In particular, it has a few features:\n",
    "1. The HTML is parsed and accessed through a `response` object in a `parse` method which in turn supports `response.xpath` and `response.css` methods, allowing one to use `xpath` and `css` selectors on the response dom, respectively.\n",
    "1. Data is stored in `scrapy.Item` objects (which are similar to `namedtuple`s) or as python dictionaries.\n",
    "1. Scrapy is object-oriented and calls it's own `parse` method (a generator) that `yield`s values.\n",
    "1. You can limit your crawls through specifying the class property `allowed_domains` and definte the starting point of your crawl using the class property `start_urls`.\n",
    "1. You can also build pipelines of crawling and data extraction steps to make sure crawling code more usable.\n",
    "1. Additional scraping steps (e.g. scraping entries in a directory like in the example above) can be accessed via `scrapy.Request`.\n",
    "1. It has command lines arguements to allow you to interactively play with the the `response` object from a webpage (`scrapy shell`) or view a page as the library renders it, which may be different from how your browser renders it (`scrapy view`).\n",
